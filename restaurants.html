                    <dt>Ask the waiter</dt>
                    <dd>Some restaurants will feature a "GF" symbol next to items that are safe, but most times they dont. Always ask the waiter if something's gluten free before you order.</dd>

                    <dt>When in doubt, ask for the manager or chef</dt>
                    <dd>Sometimes waiters wont know what gluten free means or if an item is safe for you, and that's ok. However, in these cases you should always ask for the manager or chef because they are usually more well-versed on the subject and want to ensure their customers are happy and safe from harm.</dd>

                    <dt>Download the 'Find me GF' app!</dt>
                    <dd>This app is a savior for those who are gluten free. It shows you what restaurants near you are the most celiac friendly, and restaurants that are dedicated to gluten free. There's also a whole community on there of gluten free individuals who love to help.</dd>
