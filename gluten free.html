                <p style="color:black;"> <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/gluten-free-what-does-that-mean" >Gluten is a protein that is found in various grains</a>. Some of these grains are wheat, barley, and rye. A surprising fact about gluten is that it's not just found in food. When I'm shopping for makeup products, hair products, or skincare, I have to carefully read the label to make sure there are no gluten-containing grains in them. Also, some perscription and over-the-counter medicines also use wheat in their products. </p>
