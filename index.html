                <p>Hi! My name is Olivia Markowitz, and I am a student at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" >University of Wisconsin-Madison. <strong>If there is someone who truly understands the difficulties and unknowns that come along with being gluten free, it's me</strong>. I was diagnosed with Celiac disease when I was just four years old. It was confusing and less common back then, and as a young child with less discipline, it was hard to navigate through the diagnosis. So, in this website I will help those on a gluten free diet, and those interested in starting one, understand what being gluten free means and help you successfully transition to this new lifestyle.</p>
