                <p>Starting a gluten free diet, whether by choice or because you have to for your health, starts with looking in your pantry and seeing what is safe for you to eat. While doing this, you'll find that most "normal" household foods and products contain gluten. <strong>Don't panic!</strong> Once you take a trip to the supermarket, you will realize that basically every regular food has a gluten free substitution! There's gluten free bread, pasta, chips, and a boat load of amazing gluten free snacks. A lot of progress has been made in the food industry since I was first diagnosed with Celiac disease in 2007; little me would have loved to have the vast gluten free options there are today. It makes it so much easier to begin this lifestyle.</p>
